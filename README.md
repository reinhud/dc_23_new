# Dockerized TIMM Computer Vision Backend & FastAPI 
---
---
This is a project set up for the course "Data Challenges SoSe23" at Goethe Uni.
It features a backend for a computer vision leveraging the possability of
easily extending the 'timm' to easily spin up some SOTA deep learning models.
In this project we use these models for transfer learning to classify ancient coins. 
The application is dockerized to make development easy and the service is exposed via FastAPI 
endpoints allowing the models to be interacted with and train and infer with http requests.
