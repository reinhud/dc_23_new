    Through this interface we want to make our service accessible

    We provide endpoints to get general information about the trained models,
    the best models as well as allow for training new models easily by exposing
    the timm library with hundreds of pretrained models in the background. 
    We also allow for easy inference of new imagesðŸ’¦
